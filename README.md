#  ShadowFox Python Internship – Beginner Task 1

## Task: Marvel Avengers List Operations
 
This is my first beginner-level task for the ShadowFox Python Development Internship. As part of the task, I chose to work with a custom list using Marvel's Avengers team.

###  What I Did

- I created a list of Avengers including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye.
- Then I added two more characters – Spider-Man and Doctor Strange – to show how `append()` works.
- I moved Captain America to the first position in the list to mark him as the team leader using `remove()` and `insert()`.
- To separate Thor and Hulk, I inserted Black Panther in between them by finding Thor's index dynamically.
- Later, I replaced the entire Avengers list with a new generation of heroes like Shang-Chi and Ms. Marvel to simulate a complete team update.
- Finally, I sorted the list alphabetically and printed the new leader (whoever came first after sorting).

Each step includes a print statement so it’s easy to follow what’s happening with the list.

###  Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Google Colab (you can run it on Jupyter Notebook too)

###  File Info

- **Notebook Name:** `Beginner_Task1_Marvel_ShadowFox.ipynb`
- **Repository:** ShadowFox_Python_Internship

###  Notes

This task helped me understand the core list operations in Python like `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, and using `index()` properly. I’ve added comments throughout the code to make it readable and easy to understand.

Thanks to the ShadowFox team for this amazing opportunity to learn by actually building things on my own. Looking forward to the upcoming tasks!
